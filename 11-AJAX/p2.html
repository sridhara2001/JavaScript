            <h3>What is Promises</h3>
            <p>Promise is built in constructor of javascript.</p>
            <p>A Promise object represents an operation which has produced or will eventually produce a value. Promises provide a robust way to wrap the (possibly pending) result of asynchronous request.</p>

            <h3>States of Promises</h3>
            <h4>1) Pending</h4>
            <p>The underlying operation has not yet completed or neither rejected.</p>

            <h4>2) Fulfilled</h4>
            <p>The operation has finished and promise is fulfilled with a response. (.then()) is used handle fulfilled response.</p>

            <h4>3) Rejected</h4>
            <p>The error has occurred during the operation is rejected with a reason. (.catch()) is used to catch the error.</p>

            <h4>4) Settled</h4>
            <p>A promise a said to settled (either resolved or rejected). Once the promise is settled, it becomes immutable.</p>

                  const myResponse = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
                        if (x<100) {
                              resolve("Hi Welcome to new promise response");
                        } else {
                              reject("Oops sorry my value is meet the condition.");

                        alert(value);
